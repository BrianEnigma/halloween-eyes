#Bi-Color Halloween Eyes Hardware

##Electronics, Primary

I have a lot of old parts in my parts bin. If I were to purchase everything
anew, these are what I would use:

- [Arduino Uno R3](https://www.adafruit.com/products/50) or equivalent
    - (I used an old Arduino Diecimila that I had kicking around. It's not as
      powerful as the Uno, but honestly, I only need I2C output, a digital
      input, and a few K of code.)
- [Bi-color I2C LED "backpack"](https://www.adafruit.com/products/902), some
  multiple of two (i.e. a pair for each set of eyes)
- [Motion sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/189)
- [5V Power Supply](https://www.adafruit.com/products/276)
    - (I'm actually using an older 1A supply)
- Quick connect/disconnect: a male+female for each pair of eyes plus for
  whatever lengths of extension cable you need in-between. They'll be serially
  chained together. These are the ones I used. Feel free to use anything
  readily available, as long as they're keyed so you don't connect things
  backwards and they mate tightly enough that they're not going to fall out.
    - [Male](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/3-641435-4/3-641435-4-ND/1121937)
    - [Female](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/3-640426-4/A31298-ND/696948)

##Electronics, Assorted 

The assorted bits and bobs you'd typically need for any electronics project,
including but not limited to:

- Wire
- Solder
- [Pin headers](https://www.adafruit.com/products/392) (I solder to these and
  use them as a quick connect/disconnect to the Arduino's sockets)

##Laser Cutting

If you want to go fancy like I did, you can laser cut some black acrylic frames
for each pair of eyes. It's entirely unnecessary, but it adds a nice touch by 
better hiding the electronics.

- Laser cut eye frames
- M2 x 10 bolts
- M2 nuts
